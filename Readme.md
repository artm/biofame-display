## FaceTemplate::Ptr
    to keep multiple collections of pointers to face templates and delete templates when all pointers are removed
    - at the moment this is broken and FaceTemplate::Ptr is defined as FacePointer*

## TODO lists

[ ] daily maintainance script (on startup):
    [ ] log rotate, compress old logs
    [ ] probably kill the oldest pictures / templates in Faces/new
    [ ] also for the robot
